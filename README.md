# Strata Language RFCs

This repository contains Request for Comments (RFCs) for the Strata programming language. RFCs document language features, design decisions, and implementation details.

## Repository Structure

- **`language-features/`**: Language feature RFCs
- **`README.md`**: This file (RFC index and overview)
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Contribution guidelines
- **`LICENSE`**: MIT License
- **`.github/`**: GitHub templates and workflows

## What are RFCs?

RFCs are design documents that describe:
- **What** a feature does
- **Why** it was designed that way
- **How** it works
- **Examples** of usage
- **Implementation status**

## RFC Status

Each RFC includes a status field:

- **Proposed**: Feature is proposed but not yet implemented
- **In Progress**: Feature is being implemented
- **Implemented**: Feature is fully implemented and available
- **Deprecated**: Feature is deprecated and should not be used

## Contributing

When proposing new language features:

1. Create a new RFC following the template
2. Use the next available RFC number (currently 0002)
3. Include all required sections
4. Provide examples and use cases
5. Document alternatives considered

## RFC Index

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **[RFC 0001: Constructors and Destructors](./language-features/0001-constructors-destructors.md)** - Explicit constructors and destructors for classes

## RFC Format

Each RFC should include:

- **Summary**: Brief description of the feature
- **Status**: Current implementation status
- **Author**: RFC author(s)
- **Created**: Creation date
- **Motivation**: Why this feature is needed
- **Design**: How the feature works
- **Examples**: Code examples
- **Implementation Details**: Technical details
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches evaluated
